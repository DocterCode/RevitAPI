## Versions

All the different versions of the Tag Addin.

TagByCat1, TagByCat2, TagByCat3, are all separate attempts/variations of the Tag Addin. 

TagByCatVersions is all three of these previously listed files combine into one solution, each TagByCat1, 2, and 3 being different classes within the same folder. This allows for efficiency/ease when attempting different solutions for complex problems.
