# Overview/Walkthrough/Further Reading

Some code I have provided in this repository has come straight from these walkthroughs and can be further understood with a quick read through.

[My First Revit Plug-in Overview](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/learn-explore/caas/simplecontent/content/my-first-revit-plug-overview.html "Just click it you idiot") 
was my first read through/understanding of Revit plug-ins. There are 8 lessons and all are very helpful. This overview provides you code to generate add-ins as well as line by line explanation. There is also a lot of explanation for those who have not coded in c# before.

[Simple Walkthroughs](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/Revit-API/files/GUID-BEEA9781-C8A5-4324-B213-B6A44BA78051-htm.html "Hello World :)")
for creating in Add-ins for Revit 2018: 
+ Simple functioning add-in
+ Add a new panel inside the Add-in Tab (This tutorial does not include that you need an image for it to work. Make sure inside your code in Visual Studio the file path for a 32x32 PNG image is correct. You can download this image off the web.
+ Retrieve selected elements
+ Retrieve filtered elements

[Revit API Forums](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160 "This can help you more than you know...")
 . I have searched through these forums when I have questions over the Revit API or just generalized questions over Revit. Very Helpful.
