# RevitAPI
General Revit API Plug-ins

Revit API Plu-ins:

This is a repository for those learning (BEGGINERS) the Revit API, Revit Macros, Revit Commands, and Revit Applications.
This inlcudes, but not limited to, Simple functioning add-ins, Adding new panels, Retrieve selected/filted elements and so on.

It will be updated as I continue to work on bits & pieces and I will try to comment as much as possible so new users will understand.

Before doing anything please install Revit 2018 as well as Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017. Make download Visual Studio to 
inlcude the .NET Framework 4.7.1 Version. This will be the version I am using.

Also, if you plan on using any or all of this code please check out the licence conditions, they are pretty easy to abide by :)
