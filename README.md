# Basic Revit API Coding
This is a repository for those learning the Revit API, Revit Macros, Revit Commands, and Revit Applications.
This inlcudes, but not limited to, Simple functioning add-ins, Adding new panels, Retrieve selected/filted elements, read/write from Revit, etc.

It will be updated as I continue to work on bits & pieces and I will try to comment as much as possible so new users will understand.

### Software Needed
Before doing anything please install Revit 2018 as well as Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017. Make sure the download for Visual 
Studio inlcudes the .NET Framework 4.7.1 Version. This will be the version I am using. I also have downloaded Resharper, a visual studio extension that is free for students, though this is not a requirement to have.
