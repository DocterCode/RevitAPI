General Revit API Plug-ins

I will be creating YouTube videos to go along with this code and will have the links posted as soon as I can. Hope I can help anyone in need. 

Revit API Plug-ins:

This is a repository for those learning the Revit API, Revit Macros, Revit Commands, and Revit Applications.
This inlcudes, but not limited to, Simple functioning add-ins, Adding new panels, Retrieve selected/filted elements and so on.

It will be updated as I continue to work on bits & pieces and I will try to comment as much as possible so new users will understand.

Before doing anything please install Revit 2018 as well as Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017. Make sure the download for Visual 
Studio inlcudes the .NET Framework 4.7.1 Version. This will be the version I am using.

Also, if you plan on using any or all of this code please check out the licence conditions, they are pretty easy to abide by. :)
